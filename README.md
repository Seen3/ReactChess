# Some Info

So I made this project for learning React

## Info

There are no fixed rules, anything can be moved anywhere provided the turn is correct. Like playing in a real board with no guidelines.

There's no way of bringing back lost pieces, adding new pieces and of pawns changing to other pieces at the end of the board.

The last one could be added but now the semester with web developement is over. Sooo

Here's a completed and playable chess board. It does not look very pretty but does the job.

Now in algorithm course I am learning how to make proper readable code in different files. This one was not made that properly. 

IDK how to host a react app on github :( btw, the page will show this beautiful readme, but the board can be used by zip and npm run. :)
